# FINDINGS.md

**What was MEASURED and what it means.** Every empirical result: calibration numbers,
training diagnostics, sweep outcomes, timings, failures.

Companion document: `DECISIONS.md` records what was *chosen*. Keep them distinct — a
decision is a choice, a finding is a number. A finding never argues for a design; if a
finding motivates a change, the change gets its own `DECISIONS.md` entry that cites the
finding.

## Rules for this file

- **Record the number BEFORE analysing, tuning, or trying to improve it.** A number
  written down after three rounds of tuning is not the same number. The first honest
  measurement is the one that has evidential value; everything after it is conditioned
  on what was already seen.
- **Negative results are recorded with the same weight as positive ones, and are never
  overwritten.** H2 failing is a publishable finding (`PROJECT_SPEC.md` section 4.1) —
  but only if it was written down when it happened.
- **Never edit a past entry's numbers.** If a result is superseded, add a new entry that
  references the old one. Corrections to *interpretation* are appended to the entry as a
  dated note; the raw numbers stay untouched.
- Every entry records the commit hash it was measured at. A finding without a commit is
  not reproducible and is therefore not a finding.

### F1 — Environment: pinned stack, CUDA path works on the RTX 4050
Date: 2026-09-03 | Session: S0 | Commit: caf77de
Config: n/a | Seed(s): n/a
Command: `python scripts/verify_env.py`

Numbers:
```
python            : 3.11.9 (AMD64)
platform          : Windows-10-10.0.26200-SP0
numpy             : 2.4.6
pyyaml            : 6.0.3
torch             : 2.6.0+cu124
torch CUDA build  : 12.4
torch_geometric   : 2.8.0.post1
cuda available    : True
gpu               : NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Laptop GPU
compute capability: 8.9
forward-pass device: cuda
GraphSAGE forward : OK - shape (12,), range [0.4056, 0.5423]
```
Driver 581.86. `torch-scatter` / `torch-sparse` / `pyg-lib` are NOT installed
(DECISIONS.md D18); `SAGEConv` runs on the pure-PyTorch fallback.

Install note: the cu124 Windows wheel is 2,532,350,702 bytes and the link dropped
twice mid-download (`NameResolutionError` on `download-r2.pytorch.org`, once at
506 MB). `pip install` has no usable resume across those failures. What worked was
fetching the wheel with a resumable downloader (`curl -C - --retry`) and then
`pip install`ing the local file. Measured link throughput ~1.8 MB/s.

Interpretation: the CUDA path is fully working, so no CPU fallback was needed - but
note that the S0 pipeline still runs on CPU by choice, for determinism (D19), not
because CUDA failed.

### F2 — Walking skeleton runs end-to-end and is bit-reproducible
Date: 2026-09-03 | Session: S0 | Commit: caf77de
Config: `configs/demo.yaml` | Seed(s): 20260903
Command: `python run.py --config configs/demo.yaml` (run twice, output compared)

Numbers:
```
scenario         : 20 RSUs, 4 backhaul segments, 60 vehicles, 8 steps
weights          : alpha=1.0 beta=0.5 gamma=0.3
total decisions  : 23
distinct RSUs    : 14
mean score       : 0.026274
trust range      : [0.3850, 0.4265]   (UNTRAINED model)
run 1 sha256     : d04344427fc4471526033b85b06d5d3dbf4da08cecf1995debe7bf2072b298f0
run 2 sha256     : d04344427fc4471526033b85b06d5d3dbf4da08cecf1995debe7bf2072b298f0
pytest           : 20 passed in 10.03s
```

Interpretation: the pipeline is reproducible from (config, seed) as Standing Rule 7
requires; the narrow trust range (0.385-0.427, spread 0.042) is the expected signature
of an untrained sigmoid head on random features and is a baseline to compare against
once training exists - not a result about trust.
