# FINDINGS.md

**What was MEASURED and what it means.** Every empirical result: calibration numbers,
training diagnostics, sweep outcomes, timings, failures.

Companion document: `DECISIONS.md` records what was *chosen*. Keep them distinct — a
decision is a choice, a finding is a number. A finding never argues for a design; if a
finding motivates a change, the change gets its own `DECISIONS.md` entry that cites the
finding.

## Rules for this file

- **Record the number BEFORE analysing, tuning, or trying to improve it.** A number
  written down after three rounds of tuning is not the same number. The first honest
  measurement is the one that has evidential value; everything after it is conditioned
  on what was already seen.
- **Negative results are recorded with the same weight as positive ones, and are never
  overwritten.** H2 failing is a publishable finding (`PROJECT_SPEC.md` section 4.1) —
  but only if it was written down when it happened.
- **Never edit a past entry's numbers.** If a result is superseded, add a new entry that
  references the old one. Corrections to *interpretation* are appended to the entry as a
  dated note; the raw numbers stay untouched.
- Every entry records the commit hash it was measured at. A finding without a commit is
  not reproducible and is therefore not a finding.

## Entry format

```
### F<n> — <title>

Config: <config file> | Seed(s): <seeds>
Command: <the exact command run>

Numbers:
  <raw measurements, verbatim - no rounding beyond what was printed>

Interpretation: <one line - what this means, not what to do about it>
```
